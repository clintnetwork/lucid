## Introduction

Lucid is currently in an embryonic state but we wish to achieve a fast, secure and distributed key-value store accessible through an HTTP API, we also want to propose persistence, encryption, WebSocket streaming, replication and a lot of features.

## Works Progress

<ins>__**Warning: Empty project for now, the development is ensured in the [development](https://github.com/lucid-kv/lucid/tree/development) branch.**__</ins>

- [x] Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
  - [x] Initialization process
  - [x] Configuration files handling
  - [x] JWT token Issuing
  - [ ] HTTPS Support
  - [x] Rest API
     - [x] KV-Base, HashMap-based
     - [ ] JWT Authentication
- [ ] WebUI in VueJS
- [ ] Persistence
- [ ] Encryption on the Fly (AES-256)
- [ ] Access Control List (ACL)
- [ ] WebSocket or Event Source (SSE)

## Some Use Cases

- Private Keys Storing (for a wallet by example)
- IoT: collect and save statistics data
- A distributed cache for an application
- Service Discovery
- Distributed Configuration
- Blob Storage

## Command Line Interface
